            <p>Hello, i'm Alya Nurfaridah.you can call me Alya. I was born on April 16th 2004 in Sungai Penuh, Jambi City. 
                I have a brother and I am the second child. I am presently enrolled in the second level of semester 3 of the computer science 
                education study program at the Indonesian University of Education, where I am pursuing a bachelor's degree. 
                The program began in 2022. Journaling and watching movies are two of my pastimes. Aside from that, I'm interested in 
                social issues like volunteering and committee work as well as the field of education.
